        <h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
        <p>
          I may have said it before, but Neoquest isn't the most difficult game
          in the world. However, the game is no walk in the park if you play it
          blind. In this section, you will learn about a few key mechanics
          related to battling. Keep them in mind and you won't lose a single
          battle the entire game (unless you get really, really unlucky).

            >Core Game Mechanic: Level Difference + Hit Rate.</span
          ><br />
          Extremely simple, yet perhaps the most important mechanic in the game.
          Your level compared to the enemy's level determines not only how often
          you hit/miss, but also how often they hit you. If you find yourself
          one level under, you start missing a lot and will find your potions
          diminishing. If you are two levels under or more, it will seem nearly
          impossible to hit your enemy. Likewise, the same is true for your
          enemies. Once you gain a level or two over them, it should be smooth
          sailing. Later on in the skills section, we will talk about how one
          particular skill tree (Fire) can get around this mechanic, but
          otherwise treat it as law.
        </p>

          <span class="red-text bold-item"
            >Core Game Mechanic: Elemental Resistance</span
          ><br />
          Elemental attacks are among the most devastating attacks in the game.
          In the endgame, you would be hard-pressed to find a monster, let alone
          a boss that doesn't have one of these. Monsters will regularly chunk
          you for 80-100 damage, and bosses will hit you with a nasty 70 Shock
          damage + 3 turn stun combo. Your health at max level is 270, by the
          way. Simply put, it's unreasonable to expect yourself to heal through
          all this damage. So what's the good news? Unlike basic attacks,
          elemental damage can be resisted partially or entirely, and you can
          increase your resistance to it via the Fortitude skill in the Shock
          skill tree. This means that Fortitude is almost an essential skill if
          you want to reliably take on the endgame bosses.<br /><br />

          You can win a game without Fortitude. You will not have fun doing so.
          You have been warned.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="red-text bold-item"
            >Minor Game Mechanic: Weapon-Skill Tree Synergy</span
          ><br />
          So here's a fun mechanic. There are a huge number of passive skills in
          most skill trees that simply activate when you attack. What's so
          interesting about that? Well, most of them gain increased strength if
          you use a weapon with a matching elemental type! Not only does the
          proc rate massively increase in most cases, but the damage of a couple
          of these skills literally doubles. In the early game, you can
          consistently be dealing multiple times your regular attack damage when
          your passive skills proc. Just think about that.
        </p>

        <p>
          I truly think that these are the only mechanics a player needs to know
          to win any random encounter, and also most boss fights. You can plan
          around them accordingly, so there's no excuse for not doing so! Of
          course, if you want to go for a non-standard build or take some risks,
          there's nothing wrong with that. Play the game the way that you enjoy
          it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fun fact: you used to be able to heal while stunned by copy-pasting
          the URL for using a particular healing potion, essentially
          guaranteeing you victory in every fight. However, I believe that got
          patched out relatively early on in Neoquest's lifespan, so we're stuck
          with the chance of getting stunned for 3 rounds and having to replay
          the entire game on InSaNe.
