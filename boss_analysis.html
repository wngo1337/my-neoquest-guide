        <h2>Boss Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          Here, we are going to talk about every single boss in the game. Yes,
          that includes the Archmagus of Roo even if I recommend skipping him in
          my walkthrough. Aside from skill tree analysis, this section is
          probably my favourite and one of the most interesting parts of this
          guide.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the funny things about bosses in Neoquest is that the majority
          of them can be trivialized by overlevelling. Bosses are generally safe
          to fight at one level above (with some very important exceptions), and
          two or three levels above is often overkill. However, you should
          remember that level difference is tied to hit rate, so being one or
          two levels down on a boss could be disastrous.
        </p>

                Xantan is the very first boss that you will meet in the game,
                appearing at the end of the fourth floor of the Dank Cave. There
                is nothing exceptional about him except that he can hit you with
                20 damage elemental blasts, dealing a significant chunk of your
                health at this point in the game. This shouldn't be a problem if
                you are at the recommended level and have a couple of Standard
                Healing Potions lying around in case you get very unlucky and he
                hits you with more elemental blasts than expected.
              </p>
              <p>
                In summary, keep attacking and keep your HP above 20, maybe 40
                if you want to avoid any stress. Clap Xantan and then go get
                your nice weapon and armour upgrades back at Neopia City.

                Kreai is the first boss that you will fight in the Jungle Ruins.
                Of course, you could do some sequence breaking and fight Gors
                and Rollay first, but that would make no sense. Anyway, Kreai is
                what I would consider to be your first real challenge in
                Neoquest. He hits very hard with his elemental blasts, and his
                2-turn stun introduces an element of unpredictability in this
                fight.
              </p>
              <p>
                What does this mean for you? It's means that you shouldn't sleep
                on Kreai's damage output. Any time that you are under 80 HP and
                not healing is a potential death courtesy of a potent combo:
                <span class="red-text"
                  >2-turn stun + elemental blast + elemental blast</span
                >, wiping out the majority of your health bar without you being
                able to do anything about it. You would say that the chance is
                quite low, but it's a long walk back if you lose, and it has
                certainly happened to me.
              </p>
              <p>
                As such, the guideline here is to always keep your health above
                80, and you should not have any major problems with Kreai.

                This set of skills is much more dangerous than it looks. If Gors
                dualcasts his stun + elemental blast combo, you will lose with
                very little counterplay.<br /><br />

                Gors is the second boss you meet in the Jungle Ruins, and he is
                a whole different beast than Kreai. Not only is he the hardest
                part of the Jungle Ruins, but I would go as far as saying that
                he is one of the toughest bosses in the game. If you didn't read
                his ability description properly, you might be asking why
                because he actually deals less damage than Kreai at first
                glance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Well, remember when I said that Kreai was dangerous because of
                his stun followed by heavy elemental damage on the next turn?
                Gors is the first of the bosses to take this to the next level,
                hitting you with a 2-turn stun <strong>and</strong> blasting you
                with elemental damage in the same turn. This means that not only
                are you chunked for roughly 23% of your total health at this
                point of the game in one turn, but you also can't move for two
                turns afterwards while he wails on you. If that wasn't bad
                enough, he can also apply a poison DoT on you that doesn't take
                up his turn after its initial cast, meaning that you can be
                stunned, poisoned, and getting hit without being able to do
                anything. Lastly, Gors is the first of several bosses that
                introduce the nightmare scenario of stunblast chains, chunking
                your healthbar and leaving you unactionable for a total of 4
                turns (or worse). If this happens (and it does happen), you are
                going back to Neopia City.
              </p>
              <p>
                Luckily, it's not all doom and gloom versus Gors. You can
                outlevel him to the point where he is no longer an issue, and
                you will likely resist some of his poison and stunblast procs.
                Keep your HP as high as possible without wasting potions in case
                you get hit with a stunblast, and you should come out on top if
                you don't get unlucky. Gors is a worthy keeper of the Staff of
                Ni-tas, required for your next and very significant weapon
                upgrade.

                Honestly, Rollay is a walk in the park compared to Gors. Not
                only is his level filled with very good opportunities to
                powerfarm, but he also doesn't possess any outstanding
                abilities. He's also completely optional if you don't mind
                fighting Faleinn at full power (don't do this), but his dungeon
                leads very well into the next section of the game, the Techo
                Caves.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I mentioned, Rollay does not have any elemental blasts. His
                3-turn stun may look scary, but you will realize that it is
                harmless without additional threats. I think you could easily
                survive even 6 turns of being stunned if you aren't
                underlevelled, and his heal does nothing but prolong the fight a
                little more, which is no issue if you are running the Nature
                Wand and haven't burned all your potions.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is little to say in terms of strategy about Rollay. Don't
                let your health dip too low and keep attacking until you win. He
                will give you a very useful item for later.

                The Archmagus of Roo is the face of Neoquest and what many would
                consider to be one of the toughest bosses in the game. I would
                tend to agree, as he is basically Gors on steroids, and not only
                does he heal a lot, but he heals more often. On the other hand,
                he is also what I would call entirely skippable with little
                consequence because a weapon upgrade is coming at level 42, but
                you can fight him if you want.
              </p>
              <p>
                On top of the potential 6-turn stun when the Archmagus dualcasts
                his stunblast, you'll also notice that he has a lot more going
                on in the sustain department. One heal will wipe out multiple
                turns of damage that you dealt, and his drain is arguably even
                worse, chunking you for 50 damage (roughly 27% of your HP at
                level 33) and restoring it to himself. As a result, the fight
                can go much longer than you would expect if you did not level
                properly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like most bosses in this game though, the battle can be made
                significantly easier just by outlevelling the Archmagus, and
                even trivialized if you go high enough. If you plan to fight him
                normally, then just be liberal with your healing, keeping your
                HP topped up so that you don't get caught off guard when his
                3-turn stunblast hits. You will very likely see him go below 100
                HP only to see him heal it all back, but again you should win
                the sustain war with the number of Strong/Greater Healing
                Potions that you have stashed, and you will soon be able to
                craft the Life Staff that grants you a free 100 HP heal every
                battle, so don't skimp on the potion usage.

                The Elemental Magic Guardians are your one stop shop for endgame
                weapon upgrades. None of them are particularly difficult, but
                each one has a special ability related to the elemental magic
                that they represent. There is no particular order that you need
                to fight the guardians, but I highly recommend that you fight
                the Guardian of Life Magic first to pick up the Moonstone Staff
                since it a major QoL upgrade for the rest of the game.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'd like you to take note right now that every boss in the
                Mountain Fortress possesses a 70 HP drain, which should not be
                too surprising or dangerous at this point. Just keep it in mind
                as I may not touch on it much later on in the section.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Guardian of Life Magic is what I would call the single most
                pleasant boss fight in the game. Not only does it not have any
                elemental magic at all, a rarity for bosses at this stage of the
                game, but it also drops arguably the best general-purpose weapon
                in the game as a reward as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                The only thing really noteworthy thing about the Guardian of
                Life Magic is that it has considerably higher HP than its other
                elemental counterparts. It has a decent drain, but given that
                the only other way for it to attack you is its basic attack,
                there is little danger in this fight. As long as you keep your
                HP above 70 and keep wailing away at it, you should have little
                trouble defeating the Guardian of Life Magic and getting your
                endgame weapon upgrade.
              </p>
              <p>
                The next bosses that we will talk about are the Guardian of Ice
                Magic, and the Guardian of
                <span class="red-text">fire</span> Magic. To be entirely honest,
                these bosses should be a cakewalk after getting your Moonstone
                Staff. In fact, even the enemies that you fight in their
                respective areas can deal more damage than each of them can, so
                they are essentially slightly stronger mooks. The only thing
                that you need to worry about is getting chunked for 90 damage by
                the <span class="red-text">fire</span> guardian or 70 damage by
                the ice guardian, which is definitely not pleasant, and they
                also both have a 70 HP drain as well. Since neither of these
                bosses can stun you, just keep your HP above 100 and you will
                win guaranteed. As a side note, the Iceheart Staff is incredibly
                powerful in its own right, not for random encounters but for the
                endgame bosses, but more on that in the equipment section.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second last boss in this area is the Guardian of Spectral
                Magic, and it very well may be the easiest boss in the game at
                this point. Its only unique skill is a defence disable, which
                increases the chance of the enemy hitting you on subsequent
                turns. Given that it can only basic attack you for damage, if
                you invested in Spectral, this boss may be the easiest one in
                the game because you will dodge many of its attacks. If not, you
                will use a few extra potions. Either way, an incredibly easy
                fight.
              </p>
              <p>
                The final boss we will talk about in this section is the
                Guardian of Shock Magic. While a 4-turn stun may sound
                intimidating, this guy will also do nothing except basic attack
                you during those turns. Don't forget about the drain though.
                Despite the lack of elemental damage skills, this guardian may
                be the most dangerous fight in this section if you get hit a lot
                with drains or attacks during the stuns, so I recommend that you
                keep your HP topped up during this encounter. If you are running
                a Shock-focused build, the Thunderstar Staff is also a very
                viable endgame weapon choice because it increases the chance of
                a Shock Weapons proc.

                Depending on choices that you have made so far in the game,
                Faleinn can either be the easiest or the absolute most difficult
                boss fight in the entire game, and I believe that this is by
                design as a reward for restoring the Kelladrian Medallion to its
                original form in Sunny City, or as a punishment for neglecting
                to do so depending on how you look at it. The good news is that
                if you played the game properly, you can show Faleinn the
                Kelladrian Medallion in battle to instantly defeat her. However,
                if you skipped Rollay Scaleback, who drops the Rusty Medallion,
                or were either too lazy or forgot to meet Gali Yoj at Sunny City
                to polish it, then you will have to face her head-to-head.
              </p>
              <p>
                Faleinn is very different from every other boss in the game
                because she seems to be the only one who almost completely
                neglects basic attacking in favour of spamming her elemental
                abilities. It is extremely common to go start this battle and
                instantly be hit with a stunblast, losing 70 HP (roughly 27% of
                your total HP at this point) of your health and being unable to
                move for 3 turns. During those 3 turns, she will very likely
                follow up with 70 damage elemental blasts as well, or if you are
                unlucky enough, she will chain another stun and you will lose.
                In addition to that, she has a 90 HP drain, swinging the fight
                by an entire 180 HP. This is the only boss outside of the final
                three where you have to watch your potions because it is very
                possible to lose most of them just to survive her damage. When
                you get her low, she will heal, and you will be right back to
                where you started minus a couple of potions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Faleinn can one hundred to zero you in just 4 turns, a distinct
                possibility off any stunblast that you do not resist. Your
                health has to be 90%+ for the entire duration of the fight, and
                you may still find yourself back at Neopia City anyway. Do not
                be surprised at all if this happens.
              </p>
              <p>
                How this battle usually plays out is that Faleinn will
                consistently chunk you for 70-90 damage on most turns depending
                on the ability that she uses. Your opportunity to attack is when
                you find yourself at near max HP at the beginning of a turn.
                This could be from outhealing her damage on the previous turn,
                when you resist an elemental blast, or when she attacks and
                misses or simply deals low damage. Then you cross your fingers
                and hope that you do not get stunblasted, and you repeat this
                cycle until you eventually whittle her down. Of all battles in
                this game, this is arguably the most RNG-dependent one aside
                from maybe Jahbal.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a side note, be sure to restore your Greater Healing Potions
                from the mobs outside Kal Panning if you fought Faleinn without
                the medallion. If you forget to do so and pass through the cave
                to the Two Rings section of the game,
                <strong>you are out of luck</strong>. Two Rings enemies do not
                drop Greater Healing Potions, and the only way to get more is to
                die and go back to an area where they drop. This is not an
                option on InSaNe, meaning that you have permanently lost a
                significant chunk of your health stores for the consecutive
                endgame boss fights. That being said, if you chose to fight
                Faleinn without the medallion on InSaNe, you have bigger
                problems...

              <p>
                Jahbal is the first of potentially three big bads that you will
                meet at the end of the game depending on the difficulty level
                that you selected, and your encounter with him will set the
                stage for your other battles. This is never an easy fight, and
                you will want to make sure that your potion inventory is as
                close to maxed as possible before coming in, even the Strong and
                Standard variants.
              </p>
              <p>
                Much like Faleinn, Jahbal is not only a certified potion
                drainer, but also a genuine one hundred to zero threat on any
                given turn thanks to his stunblast. Even worse, his 90 damage
                elemental blasts will remove 33% of your max HP each turn when
                they fully land. If you thought that sounded bad, I am not
                finished yet. He can inflict a 5-turn 50 damage poison on you,
                and recall that the poison proc is a separate damage tick,
                meaning that he can also separately chunk you with a stunblast,
                taking 120 damage from your health bar and still leaving you
                stunned for 3 turns. If this happens, you will need a miracle to
                survive both the poison and his attacks at the same time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jahbal is no slouch in the sustain department either. Even worse
                than his elemental damage, his drain siphons 100 HP (37% of your
                max health, fair and balanced) and adds it to himself. Along
                with his 150 HP restore, I think you can see why he poses a
                genuine threat to your potion supply. Do not be surprised if you
                have spent ten turns landing damage only for him to drain you
                and then restore himself to full HP while leaving you down a few
                potions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, Jahbal can disable your defence and heavily increase his
                hit rate against you. While much less dangerous than everything
                else listed above, consecutive basic attacks still deal heavy
                damage and force you to heal, so you'll be happy if you decided
                to invest in Spectral magic.
              </p>
              <p>
                With all that said, you may ask what the strategy is here. There
                are a couple of routes that you can take depending on the skill
                trees that you invested in. The most obvious choice would be the
                Moonstone Staff because it not only alleviates the heavy potion
                usage required for Jahbal, but it does so in the form of passive
                healing from its regeneration and ability, potentially saving
                your life when you are stun-locked. Regardless of your build, if
                in doubt, this is the correct choice.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another interesting choice would be the Thunderstaff Staff if
                you are running a Shock build. The increased stun chance for
                Shock Weapons is generally good, the passive stun chance from
                Staggering Stun can save you from a surprising amount of damage
                over the course of a fight, and it may also be a lifesaver if it
                procs when you are stunned. This weapon feels less safe than the
                Moonstone Staff because you don't get direct healing, but every
                turn that your enemy is stunned is a turn where you are
                guaranteed to not take damage. Highly recommended as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you are running an attack-focused Ice build, then the
                Iceheart Staff may actually optimal choice here because of its
                boost to the proc rate of your Ice skills, and more importantly,
                its incredibly powerful active skill, Ice Wind. I will not
                discuss details about it here because weapons have their own
                dedicated section, but Ice Wind essentially give you an extra
                passive stun chance for several turns on top of anything you are
                inflicting from basic attacks. I have tested this on Evil and it
                is completely viable.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the weapon choice out of the way, there is actually quite
                little to say in terms of specific strategy. Your health must be
                maxed or close to it every single turn of this fight. If you
                have been hit by a disable, chances are that you will need to
                spam Strong Healing Potions until it wears off because his basic
                attack accuracy will be off the charts. If you are affected by a
                poison, same idea. Do not take chances gambling that you will
                resist the poison. A stunblast with poison or disable active all
                but guarantees a loss even from full health, so you need to
                minimize the risk here. Do not try to save potions in this
                fight. Heal every time it is necessary, topping up your HP bar
                every turn. With some luck and patience, you should win.

                The good news is that if you got past Jahbal, Mastermind is a
                cake walk in the majority of cases. He has no stun at all, so
                the way to beat him is very straightforward. However, the
                simplicity of this fight is also what can be a major stress
                factor depending on how your fight with Jahbal went. If you have
                a healthy potion supply, then beating Mastermind is a formality.
                On the other hand, if your supply is starting to dwindle, then
                you may want to start worrying.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mastermind dishes out tons of damage with his elemental blasts,
                each one consumes a full Superior Healing Potion worth of
                health. He doesn't quite spam them like Faleinn, but if you get
                unlucky enough, you will be burning potions very quickly. Like
                other endgame bosses, Mastermind also has a drain as his source
                of sustain, and it theoretically heals 50% more than the most
                powerful drains in the game, dealing 150 damage over three
                turns. This also means that you get three chances to resist the
                drain rather than one though. However, the important thing to
                remember about this ability is that it is a passive proc after
                the initial cast. What this means is that
                <strong
                  >Mastermind can hit you with 120 damage elemental blasts on
                  the same turn that it procs</strong
                >. This is more damage than any single healing potion in the
                game can recover, and it happens more often than you might
                think. Because of this, there is a 171 HP threshold that you
                must meet every turn that Mastermind's drain is active.
                Otherwise, you risk losing 63% of your HP in one turn and dying.
                Technically, it's not impossible for him to do multiple times
                during the drain, so if you really want to be cautious, stay
                above 191 HP in case he does this combo twice in a row.
              </p>
              <p>
                With all that said, Mastermind is still a significantly easier
                fight than Jahbal, and you should have little to no issues if
                you have invested some points into Shock magic, Fortitude
                specifically. I will say that I was dangerously close to running
                out of potions when I ran Evil mode on a
                <span class="red-text">fire</span> build because of the small
                number of points in Fortitude, but it was also just an unlucky
                run. Full Life and full Shock builds should breeze through him.
                Just remember, 171 HP whenever a drain is active, or 121 HP
                otherwise are the minimum values to meet for any given turn.

                For being the big bad at the end of the hardest game mode,
                Xantan Reborn is a walk in the park. He is relatively tanky with
                1000 HP to his name, but with no real abilities or even a source
                of sustain, I am inclined to think that the game devs purposely
                made him weak because of the two previous bosses that you faced.
                Unless you are running out of potions of course, which you very
                well may be at this point.
              </p>
              <p>
                Xantan's only quirk is that every attack he lands will deal
                exactly 50 damage, and his hit rate is extremely high. Nearly
                every turn that he is not stunned, he will hit you for 50
                damage. That's less damage than a Strong Healing Potion though.
                Not only that, but he's also very weak against Spectral magic
                because of his basic attack dependency, meaning that Spectral
                users can take full advantage of Evasion and Reflex in this
                fight.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regardless of the skill trees that you chose, if you made it
                this far, then Xantan Reborn should go down without much
                trouble. You don't have to worry about potion usage anymore, and
                even your lower tier potions should suffice for healing against
                him. You are basically fighting a really tanky mook, and it will
                definitely feel like it.
