          Skills are the heart of Neoquest. Not all skill trees provide the same
          level of power, and that's okay. Trees tend to spike in power at
          different points of the game, so you can choose whether you'd like to
          trivialize the early-midgame, or whether you want to completely crush
          the endgame. Each tree is still more than capable of getting you
          through the game.

          Fire gets a bad rep in pretty much every Neoquest guide that I have
          seen, not that I have seen many new Neoquest guides have come out
          recently. Regardless, I agree in some ways that you get better value
          by investing in other trees, but Fire is by no means a weak tree. The
          power you get early on is actually very significant, and it stays
          effective for the rest of the game even if it falls off a little
          towards the end. Grinding is very quick at any stage of the game
          because of your sheer damage output from skills and weapons, though
          you do need to keep an eye on your health bar during boss fights
          because
          <span class="red-text bold-item"
            >this tree provides exactly zero defensive power</span
          >. <br /><br />
          A key thing to note about this tree is that using a Fire weapon at all
          stages of the game is recommended for the weapon + skill synergy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="red-text bold-item">Skill 1: Fire Weapons</span>
          <br />
          Fire Weapons on its own is a very powerful skill, and its damage when
          combined with Firepower is more than enough to breeze your way through
          the early to midgame with zero issues. In theory, you could max Fire
          Weapons and Firepower to unlock your 14 fire damage procs by level 11.
          That's pretty insane considering the amount of HP that enemies have
          and the amount of damage that your basic attacks do at that point of
          the game. Of course, some might argue that it's a little more sensible
          to go Fire Ball and get the burst damage at the start of your random
          encounters, or even go one step further and spread evenly to get Wall
          of Flame active early on as well. As you can see, there are already
          many ways for skill investment to go so early on. Regardless, Fire
          Weapons is absurdly strong in the early game, scales well into the
          midgame, and then tapers off to a reasonable damage boost in the
          endgame, though you should note that it tends to get resisted quite a
          bit by endgame bosses. By all counts, it is still a very respectable
          skill, but I have just one reservation about it, which is that it is
          strictly inferior to its Ice counterpart, though we will discuss that
          later.

          <br />
          I think the Neoquest devs were either really lazy or ran out of ideas
          when coming up with this skill because its only purpose seems to be
          making you waste points before you can reap the benefits of the more
          powerful skills further down the tree, and it's also required to get
          the full power of Fire Weapons. Technically, it does boost the power
          of Fire Ball as well, but you would literally never know because you
          cannot invest in Fire Ball without investing in Firepower first. The
          skill makes very little sense. Perhaps the devs thought maxing Fire
          Ball or Wall of Flame early on was too powerful. There is nothing that
          would make you want to invest in this skill besides it being a
          requirement to get to the better skills. I don't think that should
          really be how it works, so my opinion of this skill is quite low. It
          would be higher if Fire skills had greater damage outputs than their
          Ice counterparts, but I think you already know that's not the case.

          <br />
          Fire Ball is a pretty standard castable fire skill. It does a good
          chunk more damage than your basic attack in the early to midgame,
          serving as a bit of burst to start off your battles, but the cooldown
          at lower skill levels basically means that you will only get to cast
          it once per random encounter, and at higher levels, your basic attack
          with Fire Weapons procs and the Inferno Robe will easily outdamage it
          since it maxes out at 45 damage at level 10. In addition, much like
          Fire Weapons, it tends to get resisted more towards the later part of
          the game, particularly against bosses. Nonetheless, it serves its
          purpose well for the majority of the game, and it's also a
          prerequisite for Wall of Flame, so it's really not optional.

          <span class="red-text bold-item">Skill 4: Wall of Flame</span>
          <br />
          This skill is the crown jewel of the Fire skill tree, and whether you
          invest in Fire or not depends entirely on whether you want to use this
          skill or not. It is very weak early because the value per skill point
          is distributed more heavily towards the last five levels of the skill,
          but it wreaks havoc at level 10, dealing a massive 22 fire damage
          <span class="bold-item"
            >for every basic attack the enemy lands on you</span
          >. Unlike many other skills in this game, there is no RNG here. What
          this means is that enemies will whittle down their own health bars
          whenever they hit you, and the damage adds up very quickly. It's a
          passive, so you don't need to spend a turn to cast it, and it provides
          a relatively reliable source of damage against bosses who don't spam
          elemental skills too. You might argue that enemies in the endgame
          start using more elemental skills, but keep in mind that every single
          enemy in the game uses basic attacks, which are what the game is
          generally balanced around. Combine this skill with your basic attack
          damage, Fire Weapons procs, Blast Furnace procs, Inferno Robe damage,
          and I think it should be very clear why Fire is the most damaging
          skill tree in the game. Mandatory to invest in if you are running
          Fire. <br /><br />

          Ice is a very versatile skill tree and personally one of my favourites
          in the game. There are two main types of Ice builds, one which is
          focused on basic attacks, and the other around Glacier Strike. Both
          are entirely viable and spike at different parts of the game. Some
          might argue that Glacier Strike is unreliable because of stun
          interruptions, or that it wastes points in Heart of Ice, but it also
          has upsides that I believe make up for that. Ice is also a heavily
          offence-focused tree, but both builds have to go through Heart of Ice,
          so there is an essential element of defense as well.

          <span class="blue-text bold-item">Skill 1: Ice Weapons</span>
          <br />
          At first glance, this skill looks identical to Fire Weapons, yet I
          would consider it possibly one of the best skills in the game. Why is
          that? Because for just 10 skill points, you can max this skill out and
          start dealing 14 ice damage at level 4 with a very high proc rate.
          Your basic attacks are dealing low single digit damage at this point
          by the way. Keep in mind that this skill deals additional damage on
          top of your basic attack. This means that in the first roughly twelve
          levels of the game before you get your first weapon upgrade, this
          skill
          <span class="bold-item"
            >adds multiple times your basic attack damage on every proc</span
          >. As you hit your first weapon upgrade, this scales down to about
          1x-1.5x your basic attack, and then in the endgame, somewhere around
          0.3x your basic attack. As you can see, the value of the skill does
          diminish over time, but the sheer amount of early game power that it
          provides for minimal investment cannot be overstated. In contrast,
          Fire Weapons requires a whole 10 points more in Firepower to match the
          damage. This skill is as efficient as early game damage gets. It also
          isn't entirely wasted on Glacier Strike builds because there are turns
          where Snowball will not be available to cast on the second turn of
          your Glacier Strike, so you will basic attack occasionally.

          <span class="blue-text bold-item">Skill 2: Heart of Ice</span>
          <br />
          Heart of Ice, in a very similar way to Ice Weapons, is a skill that
          starts off incredibly strong and then dials back to normal levels of
          usefulness as you progress later in the game. This is because it only
          prevents enemies from basic attacking, and enemies in the early game
          often do very little else than that, while enemies in the mid to
          lategame start hitting you with elemental blasts and drains. Again
          though, Heart of Ice has a very high proc rate for what is essentially
          a stun in many parts of the game, and it's available as the second
          skill, meaning that no points go into unnecessary skills before you
          get to it since it synergizes well with Ice Weapons on landing basic
          attacks. This skill will save you from a lot of damage in all your
          battles because even endgame enemies still use basic attacks. Overall,
          a very solid skill.

          <span class="blue-text bold-item">Skill 3: Snowball</span>
          Snowball is the Ice equivalent of Fire Ball. At max level it even does
          the same damage. However, unlike Fireball, which you probably want to
          stop using in the endgame, Snowball serves a very specific purpose of
          not wasting your second turn while Glacier Strike is charging. When
          maxed out, its cooldown slots very well into the Glacier Strike attack
          pattern, requiring just one basic attack between Glacier Strikes to
          become available again for the second turn. Essentially, Snowball
          helps Glacier Strike transform from an okay skill into a very good
          full build. Of course, things down play out this well until you get to
          higher skill levels, which is where the other Ice skills come into
          play. You would never invest in Snowball unless you plan to invest in
          Glacier Strike, but it serves its purpose so well that I have a very
          high opinion of it.

          <span class="blue-text bold-item">Skill 4: Glacier Strike</span>
          <br />
          Glacier Strike is quite a polarizing (no pun intended) skill. Some
          people swear that it is useless and that your basic attacks and skill
          + weapon procs outdamage it in the three turns it takes to cast, while
          others swear by its reliable hit rate and burst damage. I am part of
          the latter, as I've breezed through multiple Evil mode runs without
          any issue using a Glacier Strike build. Its weakest point is
          definitely the early game, where it tends to get resisted a lot and
          Snowball's cooldown isn't low enough to easily cast it again without
          wasting the second turn. You might want to consider just basic
          attacking at this point because of how powerful Ice's first two skills
          are. However, once you reach around level 34 and the Ice tree is
          maxed, then you start really reaping the benefits. Snowball slots into
          the second turn of your charge, which means you only spend one turn
          charging Glacier Strike rather than two, greatly reducing the damage
          gap between the basic attack build and Glacier Strike. The hit rate at
          max level is also quite high, making it a reliable choice for bossing,
          especially those that you cannot gain a level lead against. Also, and
          I would consider this a decently important point, Glacier Strike is
          the only way that you will see your own character dealing three digit
          damage in a single hit. There's just something very satisfying about
          seeing yourself deal damage that exceeds your normal attack damage
          multiple times.

          The Shock skill tree is, I believe, widely considered both the most
          powerful and the most essential skill tree in the game, and for very
          good reasons. Stun is one of the most powerful status effects and the
          most powerful form of impairment in this game. It simply means that
          the enemy is unable to take any action on their turn with no
          exceptions. This also makes stun arguably one of the best defensive
          skills as well because enemies cannot hit you when they cannot act.
          Shock comes with not one, but two skills that can separately inflict
          this effect, one which also damages the enemy on proc, and the stun
          duration can stack! That's not all though. This tree also contains the
          absolute most important defense skill in the game, raising your
          resistance against the nasty elemental blasts that are very common in
          the endgame. With such a combination of defense and offense, Shock
          provides what I would consider the most enjoyable endgame experience,
          spiking heavily around the midgame when Shockwave and Fortitude fully
          come online, and continuing strongly right to the end.

          <br />
          Stun is the most powerful status effect available to you as a player.
          This skill lets you stun the enemy for one turn. That's it. It's that
          simple, and also that effective. Usually, inflicting a status effect
          on the enemy is thought of as an offensive action, but stun is
          actually a purely defensive skill, preventing any follow up from your
          enemy on the turn. As it turns out, preventing damage ends up being
          more powerful than healing in the endgame where even normal enemies
          can regularly drain you for 100 HP. Of course, stun does suffer the
          same drawback as any other status effect, which is that it can and
          does tend to be resisted more later in the game, not by the monsters,
          but by the bosses, which are by far the deadliest enemies. Regardless
          of that, Shock Weapons is still a very respectable skill, and it is a
          prerequisite for the even more important skills down the tree, so
          maxing this skill is fully recommended.

          <span class="orange-text bold-item">Skill 2: Disable</span>
          <br />
          Disable is an interesting skill if you actually understand what it
          does. I did not fully understand what defense actually did in this
          game until I read neoquest.guide actually, so I highly recommend
          checking out that site. Anyway, Disable lowers the enemy's defense
          when it procs,
          <span class="bold-item">making your enemy easier to hit</span>. The
          issue with this skill is that players get a random, watered down
          version of this skill compared to bosses. When Jahbal or the Guardian
          of Spectral Magic hit you with this skill, they hardly miss on their
          next attacks. When you proc this skill, it's hard to see a difference
          in hit rate even knowing that Disable is active, and so I find it hard
          to give this skill meaningful credit. Is it meaningful over the course
          of an entire battle? Maybe, but I even find it a little hard to
          believe that because it gets resisted a lot to begin with against
          bosses, and you weren't missing that much against normal enemies
          anyway. By far the weakest skill in the Shock tree, but perhaps that's
          just because of how powerful the rest of them are. You have to invest
          in this skill anyway, but just don't expect much from it. <br /><br />

          <br />
          I know I talked a lot about how stun is the most powerful defensive
          status effect, but Fortitude is the most powerful defensive
          <span class="bold-item">skill</span> in the game. Fortitude provides
          passive elemental resistance on every turn, meaning that it is always
          operating at full effectiveness whether you can act or not. This is an
          important distinction from Shock Weapons and Shockwave because you
          will eat 3-turn + 70 damage stunblasts over the course of the game,
          and this skill provides crucial defense against further 100+ elemental
          damage follow up from the enemy during that time. Resisting one enemy
          attack is often the difference between living and dying in a boss
          fight, but the skill is also just useful in random encounters in the
          mid to lategame against enemies who like to use elemental skills,
          often saving you an entire potion's worth of HP at once. It's even
          arguable that skipping Shockwave to put more points into Fortitude if
          you don't have enough remaining points is a sensible thing to do,
          despite Shockwave being the best skill in the game. Elemental
          resistance is important in this game. Do not forget it. <br /><br />

          <br />
          I don't think it is an exaggeration to suggest that Shockwave may be
          the single most powerful skill in the game. In fact, I am arguing
          exactly that. When you combine the most powerful status effect with
          damage that exceeds the damage of other trees' pure damage skill procs
          by 50%, package it into a single skill, and then give it a good proc
          rate, you should have an easy time seeing why I think this skill is
          broken. Shock's only offensive ability comes from this skill, and it
          is still more than enough. The stun and the damage have separate
          resist rolls, meaning that if one part fails, the other can still hit.
          If that still wasn't enough, Shockwave's proc rate and damage are
          <span class="bold-text">not affected by weapon synergy</span>, meaning
          that this is the only on-hit skill in the game that operates at full
          effectiveness regardless of the weapon you are running. It has no
          weaknesses besides being resistable and requiring investment in three
          other skills to access it. There is no better skill in the game.

          The Life skill tree is the single most powerful tree in the early to
          midgame, and it is not remotely close. The advantage of the other
          defense-oriented trees, Shock and Spectral, is that they scale based
          on how much damage that they can potentially prevent an enemy from
          dealing each turn, meaning that they reach their full potential much
          later into the game. On the other hand, Life provides consistent, raw
          healing power that comes online extremely early (full potential by
          level 24!) and quickly makes way for your second skill tree. Even
          better, Field Medic and Lifesteal don't rely on weapon synergy, so you
          can reap the full benefits of Life while completely focusing on your
          secondary tree. However, by no means am I trying to imply that Life is
          weak later on and that you will get carried by your other skill tree.
          Sure, it falls off a little turn-to-turn when enemies can deal more
          than 1/3 of your HP bar with one skill, but you will still heal a very
          significant amount over the course of each battle, even more so if you
          run the Moonstone Staff with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is one thing that we need to talk about though. If you invest in
          Life early on, expect the earlygame to be trivial... but also
          extremely slow. Unlike any other skill tree in the game, Life does not
          possess a single damage-dealing skill. What this means is that you
          will be relying solely on your basic attack damage for roughly the
          first half of the game, making battles take far more turns on average.
          This is ultimately of no consequence unless you really want to speed
          through the game for some reason, but be warned if you are easily
          bored.

          <span class="green-text bold-item">Skill 1: Life Weapons</span>
          <br />
          Life Weapons follows the power curve of its skill tree to a tee. If we
          use the base values of each healing potion for comparison, Life
          Weapons provides a healing boost of
          <span class="bold-item">100%</span>,
          <span class="bold-item">33%</span>, 16.66%, 11.11%, and 8.33%, and
          6.66% as we move up the potion tiers. That's a lot of extra earlygame
          healing from Weak and Standard Healing Potions if you couldn't tell. I
          consider the overworld healing to be somewhat inconsequential, but it
          does provide a bit of value over time. An overall solid skill that is
          necessary to get deeper into the skill tree anyway. <br /><br />

          <span class="green-text bold-item"> Skill 2: Field Medic </span>
          <br />
          Field Medic is one of your two in-combat healing skills, and while it
          doesn't amount to too much on its own, it contributes to the
          turn-to-turn healing system you get by running full Life. Like all
          Life skills, its greatest impact is in the earlygame when that 4 HP is
          a decent chunk of your health, but HP is HP at any point in the game.

          If you see the game like I do, then Resurrection seems to be largely a
          useless skill because for the vast majority of the game, you should
          never be in a position where dying is possible. If you are dying, then
          you have likely done something wrong: either not watching your HP bar
          correctly during boss fights, or not having enough levels over the
          regular enemies. If you are running offense-oriented skill trees, then
          there will be times where potions are scarce, but then Resurrection
          doesn't apply to those cases anyway. In the worst case, you can
          usually walk back. However, I propose a single scenario where
          Resurrection is not a complete waste of skill points: when you are
          running a Life build on InSaNe mode. With the investment of a single
          skill point in Resurrection, you buy yourself a very small lifeline on
          the off chance that something happens when fighting the big three
          bosses.
