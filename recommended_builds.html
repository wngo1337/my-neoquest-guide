        <h2>Recommended Builds</h2>
        <p>I am too busy to do this section right now...</p>
        <p>
          Welcome to my favourite part of the game. Interestingly, with five
          skill trees and five skills each, you might imagine that the build
          customization would be quite complex. However, this is actually not
          the case if you want a functional build because of the aforementioned
          skill tree + weapon synergy. Naturally, because you can only equip one
          weapon at a time, it is logical to maximize the value that you can get
          out of your weapon by investing in the corresponding skill tree, and
          this does tend to be the case. Some skill trees are more dependent on
          their weapon synergy than others, but the general rule is to not
          spread your skills and instead focus on a couple of trees, three at
          max if you must, and I'd recommend completely maxing at least one of
          them with the exception of Life.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to spread points over all the trees, it's probably still
          possible to beat the game with some luck. Just don't say I didn't warn
          you when you are dealing 3 additional elemental damage to bosses or
          regenerating 1 HP per turn in the endgame...
