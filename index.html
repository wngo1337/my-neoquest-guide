          Hello and welcome to my Neoquest guide. Really, it's more of a
          discussion than a guide, but call it whatever you like. Neoquest isn't
          the most popular game right now (it came out in 2004!), but whether
          it's a newbie or just myself reading this site years down the line, I
          hope that someone gets something out of it. Ultimately, this guide is
          a collection of game knowledge accumulated over many years of play and
          experimentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving on, there is one important thing that I have to get out of the
          way:
          <strong>I will not be providing any maps on this site.</strong> Sorry
          if that's what you were searching for, but there's a good reason for
          that: many others have already done it better than I ever could. If
          you are in need of them and other detailed game info, feel free to
          check out
          <a href="https://neoquest.guide" alt="neoquest.guide" target="_blank"
            >neoquest.guide</a
          >, a very cool resource that has not only a step-by-step guide, but
          also detailed information on skill proc rates and item drop chances
          that I imagine would have to have been sourced from the game database
          itself. You can also use the classic IDNQ if you can find it, but you
          may have to use Wayback Machine for that one though. However, if you
          just want to complete the game for the trophies, I can think of a
          <a
            class="green-text"
            href="https://github.com/wngo1337/neoquest-auto"
            alt="My Neoquest Completer"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer
                                                                     noopener"
            >better way</a
          >
          to do that...
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, we are going to talk about the fun parts, and those are the
          builds and equipment choices you are going to make throughout the
          game. Just how broken is Shockwave? Is the Spectral tree worth your
          time, and is fire really as useless as everyone makes it sound? If
          these are the kinds of questions you find yourself asking, then you've
          come to the right place. I think you'll find the results to be far
          more interesting than what you expect.
