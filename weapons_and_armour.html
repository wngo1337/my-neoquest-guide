          Now we're getting to the fun stuff. With five skill trees and five
          weapons for each one, there's a fair amount of customizability in
          terms of what you can go for at each stage of the game.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you're looking at the tables, you will find that the first two
          tiers of each weapon type do nothing, so is there even a difference at
          all? You would know the answer if you read the previous section. Your
          weapon type influences the proc rate and/or damage of various passive
          skills in your skill trees. If you invest in a particular skill tree,
          <span class="bold-item green-text"
            >choose a matching wand to maximize the effect of your skills</span
          >. That being said, I'm not going to do a writeup on tier 1 or tier 2
          weapons because there is nothing else interesting to cover. As I've
          stated before, you can check out
          <a href="https://neoquest.guide" target="_blank">neoquest.guide</a>
          for detailed info on proc rates. I think you'd be surprised at how low
          some of the rates are.

          So you're interested in Fire weapons. I hate to say it, but you're
          probably going to be disappointed until about level 42. Fire itself is
          not a bad tree, I can't say the same for most of the weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I didn't know any better, I would have thought that the Volcano
          Wand was bugged with how little it procs. It may as well not have an
          ability at all, and its only purpose is to increase the damage of Fire
          Weapons when it procs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving on to the Fire Staff, what a unique name. Anyway, you get a
          skill that lets you deal 40 damage on command. Sounds pretty good,
          right? Well, not exactly. At this point in the game, if you are
          investing in Fire, your basic attacks plus Fire Weapons skill procs
          are probably doing around that much damage anyway. Heck, you have
          Fireball that does 45 damage on a way lower cooldown. It's fine, but
          it's not great. Then again, you probably don't have much of a choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Firedrop Staff is a completely different beast from any Fire
          weapon you have seen so far. Recall that the flaw of the Fire Staff
          was that it made you use a turn on an ability just to deal the same
          amount of damage as your basic attack. The Firedrop Staff solves this
          issue by making its skill a powerful passive burn in the form of Blast
          Furnace. The ability has no cooldown, and multiple procs stack the
          duration. This weapon makes random encounters a breeze and also deals
          respectable damage against bosses when it isn't resisted. Unlike other
          fire weapons, this one actually does the work for you.

        <p>
          So you want to use Ice weapons. The good news is that your endgame
          staff is among the best in the game. The bad news is that your midgame
          options are essentially useless, and I really do mean it when I say
          that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similar to how half of the Fire and Ice skill trees are carbon copies
          of each other, the Avalanche Wand may very well be a copy of the
          Volcano Wand. It's not very interesting, but it gets the job done to
          increase your Ice Weapons damage and enable Heart of Ice.
        </p>
        <p>
          On first glance, maybe the Ice Staff sounds sort of interesting. It
          basically puts a damage shield on you, dealing backlash damage to the
          enemy. The only problem? 10 damage at this stage of the game is almost
          laughable, not to mention how the enemy needs to land a successful
          basic attack on you for it to even trigger. The only reason it's an
          upgrade over the Avalanche Wand is the higher weapon damage. Use this
          wand only for as long as you have to and push for the next tier.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Iceheart Staff is possibly my favourite weapon in the game, and
          for very good reason. Not only does it fix Ice's flaw of not having a
          real stun, but Ice Wind consistently works on any opponent and with
          any playstyle. I don't believe that it can be resisted at all, so the
          question is only whether you get a proc or not. It doesn't matter if
          you want to spam basic attacks or all in with your ten points in
          Glacier Strike. You cast the skill and go back to what you were doing
          while it stuns the opponent over and over. The weapon is great for
          farming and bossfighting, and Ice Wind may very well be the best
          castable skill in the game. The Ice skill tree may fall off lategame,
          but this weapon completely makes up for it. Do yourself a favour an
          try it out even if you aren't running an Ice build.

          I think everyone who knows anything about this game knows just how
          broken the Shock skill tree is, and Shock weapons do a good job at
          building on that. Despite the simplicity of the status effect, stun is
          the strongest status effect in the game, and these weapons generally
          increase your chance of inflicting it on your enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like I said above, Shock weapons are generally simple, and the Storm
          Wand is no exception. It amplifies your chance of proccing Shock
          Weapons, and it also has the chance to give you a free turn. What's
          not to like? The proc rate is just as bad as the other weapons in this
          tier, but we don't talk about that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving on, the Shock Staff's active skill doesn't make much sense to
          me in terms of synergy. Lowering the enemy's physical defense so you
          can hit harder is useful, but the point of Shock is rendering the
          enemy useless while you wail on them. The extra damage should just be
          a bonus. It's not my favourite weapon, but it's perfectly functional.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Thunderstar Staff is very simple and very good. I think you'll
          notice that there is a general trend here that the passive skills of
          final weapon upgrades are very powerful. Staggering Stun offers you up
          to two turns of stun for free while not taking up your turn to
          activate it. If you are running Shock, you will want it simply for the
          sake of proccing Shock Weapons more often. The staff is very powerful
          for both boss fights and random encounters, saving you from entire
          turns of damage, which could mean 100+ HP a turn in the endgame.
          Highly recommended for Shock builds.

          The Spectral weapon selection provides a surprisingly versatile set of
          abilities, with the endgame staff doing something a bit different from
          what you might expect. I say this because the entire Spectral tree is
          focused solely on negating and countering enemy basic attacks, and it
          is very powerful at doing so, but I will talk about it a bit later.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mountain Wand is an extremely forgettable weapon. Every once in a
          blue moon, its ability will negate a portion of the enemy's attack.
          Granted, at the level you get it, the damage negated isn't negligible,
          but the proc rate is abysmal like most other weapons in this tier.
          Even worse, the lizard enemies right after Gors on the way to Rollay
          focus especially on heavy elemental skill usage, further decreasing
          the weapon ability's utility. All that said, it still provides the
          bonus to Spectral Weapons' defence increase, potentially making it
          worth it after Rollay.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Spectral Staff has the misfortune of being in would I could call a
          pretty average tier of weapons with the exception of one. It is stil
          an upgrade over the Mountain Wand, and you do get the castable
          <span class="bold-item">Rage of Light</span>, but its effects are hard
          noticeable in combat. Of course, if you are running a Spectral build,
          then you may have fun experimenting with this weapon for the boost to
          Spectral Weapons, but the healing from the Life Staff may still be
          more desirable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, the Shadowgem Staff has a very interesting niche. This is the
          weapon that I mentioned that goes out of its way to provide something
          that its skill tree does not. If you couldn't tell from the name,
          Elemental Resistance raises your resistance to fire, ice, and stun
          attacks. I guess the intention here was to provide some defence
          against what the Spectral tree itself does not cover. I think it's an
          interesting idea and actually quite a strong ability against endgame
          bosses, but there are a few things to note about it. Firstly, it
          doesn't provide resistance against the 100 HP drains that are very
          common in the endgame (I don't think anything does), and the cooldown
          is a little long for the effect, not to mention how you have to spend
          a valuable turn casting a purely defensive skill that doesn't provide
          value against basic attacks. There is an argument to use this weapon
          with heavy Shock/Spectral builds to maximize your resistance against
          those deadly elemental attacks from endgame bosses, but I do prefer
          both of those trees' endgame weapons over the Shadowgem Staff.
          Nonetheless, this is still a genuinely good endgame weapon that grants
          the Spectral tree its full power at nullifying basic attacks, and I
          recommend at least giving it a try.

          Life weapons are arguably the most universally useful weapons in the
          game. You will always need more HP, and they do a good job of giving
          it to you. That's literally it. The best part about Life weapons is
          that the Life skill tree basically doesn't depend on the usual weapon
          + skill tree synergy to enhance its skills. You can use Life skills
          with other weapon types, and that means you can also use Life weapons
          with other skill trees quite effectively.
        </p>

          The Nature Wand is arguably broken for when you usually craft it. You
          are probably sitting right around level 22 (130 hp) when you beat
          Gors, so this thing is healing you almost 20% of your health bar when
          it procs, and the proc rate isn't completely abysmal like the other
          weapons in this tier either. For reference, the best Life weapon in
          the game heals you for 30 hp on skill proc. Maybe that all doesn't
          sound like much to you, but don't underestimate the number of potions
          this weapon will save you. If you are running a full Life build along
          with it (highly recommended), you will hardly have to touch your
          potions.

          The Life Staff is a very famous weapon, and for good reason. 100 HP is
          a huge amount at any point in the game, and you get this thing around
          level 33 (185 hp). That's more than half your health. Pretty good,
          right? But it gets better. You might look at the massive 21 turn
          cooldown on this thing and think that it's a little high even for such
          a powerful skill, and I would agree. However, you have to remember
          that cooldowns don't carry over battles. That's right: you get a free
          100 HP heal available for every battle. That makes the Life Staff
          beyond the best farming weapon in this tier. It lets you push against
          tougher enemies for better experience gains, and it basically tops you
          up after every battle if you play your cards right. Now, I actually
          recommend skipping tier 4 weapons entirely depending on how you play,
          but we'll get into that later. If you decide to play the Temple of Roo
          section of the game, then definitely get this weapon. It is by far the
          best weapon in this tier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fun fact: The Moonstone Staff used to heal 45 HP on its proc in the
          game's early days, but it was so busted that they nerfed it down to 30
          HP. Even then, it's still one of the best weapons in the game. Let's
          talk about the passive heal first. 4 HP per turn might not sound like
          much, but that damage you take during battles adds up. Over a 20 turn
          battle, you will heal 80 extra HP for free. That's almost a full
          Greater Healing Potion, and we haven't even talked about the Moonstone
          Staff's skill procs yet. Spirit of Life randomly heals you for 30 HP,
          and it procs decently often. When you're sitting at half HP, you'll be
          surprised how often you get a couple of procs in a row. Anyway, you
          get the monster healing of Life with the attack power of an endgame
          weapon, and the weapon fits into any build. I recommend this staff for
          essentially anyone in the endgame because it's so universally useful.

        <b>Summary</b>
        <p>
          So now that you have learned about all the weapons in the game, maybe
          you're wondering which ones you should be using throughout the game.
          First, let me say this: every single weapon in the game is good enough
          to get you through the game area where you receive it. Some are far
          worse than others, but if want to make a certain weapon work, you can.
          Secondly, just match your weapon to the skill tree(s) that you are
          focusing on to maximize your skill + weapon synergy. It's easy to
          remember and it works. With that said, let me summarize what I think
          are the best weapons in the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tier 1: These weapons are all carbon copies of each other except that
          they boost their respective skill tree passive skills where
          applicable. If I had to choose one, the Blue Wand enables you to proc
          Ice Weapons for multiple times greater damage than your regular attack
          at that stage in the game, though that's more about the Ice skill tree
          than anything. If you want an accelerated start, Ice is the way to go.
          Otherwise, the White Wand is a very solid pick if you are going Life
          for healing as you move around the map.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tier 2: These weapons aren't anything special either... No abilities
          means that they again only differ by their improvements to your skill
          procs. At this point in the game, Ice is still extremely strong, by
          far the best offensive magic in the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tier 3: The Nature Wand is the best weapon of this tier without a
          doubt, but if you are running Fire or Ice, I would say that the skill
          + weapon synergy actually takes priority here. At this point of the
          game, your Ice/Fire Weapons procs are probably still dealing close to
          80% of your basic attack damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tier 4: Once again, the Life Staff is the big winner of this weapon
          tier. It's hard to match the utility of a free 100 HP heal every 20~
          turns, available at the beginning of every encounter. No other staff
          here comes close, though Fire/Ice users may still consider running
          weapons matching their tree for the extra damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tier 5: The last set of weapons that you get are different from the
          previous tiers because each one is very powerful in its own way.
          Again, let me reiterate that I would recommend simply matching your
          weapon to your most invested skill tree for maximum synergy, but
          otherwise there are two standout choices here.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Moonstone Staff is undoubtedly the best staff
          <span class="bold-item">for random encounters</span> because of its
          passive healing. From the Mountain Fortress to the end of the game,
          the number of potions it will save you via its 4 HP heal per turn and
          random 30 HP bursts is incredible, and the weapon is even more
          valuable as potentially your only source of sustain if you have not
          invested in Life skills. There is no equal to this weapon's healing
          utility when grinding or moving around the map.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my experience, the best weapon in isolation
          <span class="bold-item">for boss fights</span> is the Iceheart Staff.
          The relatively reliable stun utility it provides can disrupt dangerous
          attack patterns from the enemy, and it oftens saves you from taking
          multiple turns of damage each cast. The second candidate for this
          title is unsurprisingly the Moonstone Staff because of its healing
          utility. You can never have too much HP, and you get the full value of
          the Moonstone Staff completely via passive regeneration and procs.
          It's useful even when you are stunned, and there will be times where
          you survive a stunblast and the remaining HP you have is equal to the
          healing you received from the staff. It slots well into every single
          build, and it is just a fantastic default choice if you have any
          doubts about what to equip.
