        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          At its core, Neoquest is an old school RPG that is all about the
          grind. You will spend the vast majority of your time fighting monsters
          to level up and get your skill points to complete your build. The
          other thing you do a lot of is walking around in the overworld, so if
          you don't like taking time to move across the map and go to new areas,
          Neoquest might not be your game. In addition, there is a legitimate
          storyline that you can explore by talking to NPCs, though it isn't at
          all necessary if you just want to complete the game. To be honest, I
          couldn't tell you what it's about, but I'm sure it's great!
        </p>
        <p>
          So how does Neoquest work? Well, it's a PHP RPG, and it requires a
          page reload for every action you take. Players do everything from
          moving around the map, spending skillpoints, and fighting monsters all
          by clicking links that perform the desired action. Attacking, using
          potions, fleeing, you name it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But before you get too excited, let me tell you the honest truth.
          Neoquest's core gameplay can essentially be reduced to clicking the
          attack button and seeing what happens. That's the whole reason that I
          am writing this guide: the skill theorycrafting and analysis of the
          different playstyles is far more exciting than the actual gameplay.
        </p>
        <p>
          So before you get started, let me tell you something else: the vast
          majority of the bosses in Neoquest are optional. In theory, you can
          complete the game just by beating the penultimate and final boss(es),
          though you'd be hurting for equipment for the majority of the game of
          course. I'm just saying that very few bosses are mandatory. So what
          does that mean? It means we only have to fight the bosses that are
          useful to us, i.e. the ones that drop equipment, components, or useful
          items.
